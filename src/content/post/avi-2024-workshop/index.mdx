## About the Workshop

We organized a workshop to discuss themes and the initial activities developed during the project at the [17th International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces](https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it/) (AVI 2024), held in Arenzano, Italy.

The workshop, entitled "[Digital Wellbeing for Teens - Designing Educational System](https://sites.google.com/view/digi-teens) (DIGI-Teens 2024)" was held in the morning of Tuesday, 4 June.

## Agenda

The workshop started at 09:15 with a welcome and introduction to the around 20 in-person participants, including the six members of this PRIN project team.

Until 11:00, we had four paper presentations around the workshop's topic. Each presenter had 15 minutes to talk about the work and answer any questions from the audience.

<DListItem dt="An Inclusive Board Game for Smart Thing Design with ADHD Children">
  The first presentation was by a team of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano and the Ca' Foscari University of Venice.
  As the title said, the authors introduced a board game with cards and digital artefacts to promote digital wellbeing.

<DListItem dt="Challenges and Opportunities in Leveraging Gamification for Enhancing Young People's Digital Well-Being">
  We continued with a presentation from the Fondazione Bruno Kessler. In their work, the authors reflected on gamified
  platforms to educate 11-16-year-old students towards digital wellbeing and a more conscious use of technology.

<DListItem dt=" Enhancing digital wellbeing through co-design: some preliminary results">
  The third presentation, by the University of Bologna, was about the preliminary results we obtained with this project.
  Specifically, they talked about a co-design session with 74 teenagers from the third and fourth year of high school to
  empower them to create applications for promoting awareness and knowledge of digital wellbeing among their peers.

<DListItem dt="Introducing Digital Wellbeing Learning in High School Education">
  Finally, the last presentation was from Politecnico di Torino about another activity carried out relative to the
  project: results of focus groups and interviews with 25 high-school students and seven teachers to understand current
  practices around technology use at school, as well as needs and opportunities to integrate digital wellbeing into
  school curricula.

After the presentations and the discussions of the papers, we had a 30-minute break. The PDFs of the papers are available on the workshop website.

We then dedicated one hour to an exercise to be done in two groups: starting from a series of dimensions that emerged from the presented papers, each group should design an activity for digital wellbeing, using whatever tool (digital or not) they wanted.

At the end of the hour, the two groups proposed:

1. A **card game** to share with the family how to spend their free time through stories and understand each other's point of view â€“ stepping into another person's shoes.
2. An **in-class exercise** to help children (8-12 years old) understand how they can find reliable sources with different means (ChatGPT, Wikipedia, ...), critically analyzing the pieces of information they found.

The workshop concluded with a lunch together. It was rich in interesting discussions and ideas, which can inform the project's next steps.
