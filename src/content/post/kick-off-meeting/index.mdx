## Overview

To kick-start the activities related to the project, the two teams from the involved universities (Politecnico di Torino and the University of Bologna) decided to have an in-person meeting at Politecnico di Torino. It was planned to be a full-day meeting.

The goal of the meeting was to discuss some pieces of background information needed by both partners and revise the operative plan according to the smaller budget we were assigned.

### Agenda

We followed this agenda, which allowed us to discover multiple points of contact in the various activities carried out by the two teams outside of this project, which will be beneficial to completing the project.

  Among the tools, we decided to create a private Telegram group to streamline the conversations, a website (this one,
